# Assistant Instructions

## Behavior Preferences

### Default Recommendations

**Always provide proactive recommendations after code changes, file modifications, or feature implementations.**

Include the following sections in outputs:

#### 1. Code Quality Suggestions
- Refactoring opportunities
- Performance optimizations
- Security enhancements
- Best practice improvements

#### 2. Next Steps
- Immediate follow-up actions
- Related features to consider
- Testing recommendations

#### 3. Related Features
- Features that complement the current implementation
- Edge cases to handle
- Integrations to consider

### Guidelines

- **Keep recommendations concise**: Maximum 2-3 key points per section
- **Make them actionable**: Specific, implementable suggestions
- **Be context-aware**: Tailor suggestions to the specific changes made
- **Avoid redundancy**: Don't repeat the same suggestions multiple times
- **Prioritize value**: Only include genuinely useful recommendations
