# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Security fixes are provided for the latest release in the `main` branch. If you are using an older tagged release, please upgrade and re-test before reporting a security issue.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues **privately**.

- Do **not** open a public GitHub issue, discussion, or pull request for a potential vulnerability.
- Send a report to the project maintainer/owner through a private channel (for example: the contact method listed in the repository profile).

Include as much of the following as you can:

- A clear description of the issue and its impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept if possible)
- Affected versions / commit hash
- Any relevant logs, stack traces, or screenshots (redact secrets)

## Disclosure process

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report as soon as possible.
- We will investigate and, when confirmed, prepare a fix.
- We may request additional information or testing help.
- Once a fix is available, we will publish an update and (when appropriate) include a security note in the changelog.

## Scope

This policy covers security issues in this repository, including the WordPress plugin code under `wp-content/plugins/affiliate-product-showcase/`.
