Assistant Interaction Rules
==========================

- Branch creation: The assistant MUST NOT create, checkout, or push any Git branch unless the user explicitly instructs it to do so in a direct prompt.
- Confirmation: For any action that would create or modify remote branches, the assistant will propose the exact command and wait for user confirmation.
- Exceptions: None. The assistant will always ask before making branch-related changes.
- Visibility: The assistant will record this policy in the project and in its internal task list for adherence.

If you want the assistant to create a branch in the future, please reply with an explicit instruction like: "Create branch X and push to origin".
