Assistant Interaction Rules
==========================

- Branch creation: The assistant MUST NOT create, checkout, or push any Git branch unless user explicitly instructs it to do so in a direct prompt.
- Confirmation: For any action that would create or modify remote branches, assistant will propose exact command and wait for user confirmation.
- Exceptions: None. The assistant will always ask before making branch-related changes.
- Visibility: The assistant will record this policy in project and in its internal task list for adherence.

- Git Backup Branches: When creating a manual backup branch (e.g., requested by user), branch name MUST use format `backup-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS` (Year-Month-Day-HourMinuteSecond).

If you want assistant to create a branch in future, please reply with an explicit instruction like: "Create branch X and push to origin".
