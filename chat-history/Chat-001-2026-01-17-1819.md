**User's latest question:** "why this format doesn't gets followed in every message? and why chat history file doesn't gets updated simultaneously , show chat summary in chat box and history file gets updated at the same time, why this is not happenning"

**Response provided:**
- Chat summary files are created per chat session, not per message
- Each summary focuses on one specific task
- Follow-up questions in the same session update the existing summary
- Chat box shows my responses, not the summary file
- Summary file is stored separately in chat-history/ for documentation
- The timing issue occurs because summaries are created after task completion
- Multiple messages in one session should update the same summary file
- New chat sessions create new summary files (Chat-002, Chat-003, etc.)

**Assistant Files Used:**
- ✅ assistant-instructions.md (APPLIED)
- ✅ assistant-quality-standards.md (APPLIED)
- ✅ assistant-performance-optimization.md (APPLIED)

**User's latest question:** "lets remove all complex system, lets make it simple, in chat box in every message when you give summary , include two things in top one- my sent message and another which assistant file is used, if not used than write no assistant file is used and use these two things in the chat summary top part, and copy this exact summary to the chat history file, i want to use this simple rule , what do you think?"

**Response provided:**
- Created new simple format with user message and assistant files at top
- This format will be used going forward
- All future summaries will follow this simple structure
