## Summary
Identified issue with chat history format. The assistant-instructions.md requires EVERY attempt_completion message to be stored in chat history with EXACT format (User Request + Assistant Files Used + Summary + timestamp). The initial Chat-002 file was a SUMMARY DOCUMENT instead of individual attempt_completion entries. Updated Chat-002 to follow correct format with multiple entries stacked, latest at top, matching Chat-001 format. No script issues or conflicts - just needed to follow the exact format specification.
