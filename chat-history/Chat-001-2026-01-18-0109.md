"do you have doc to follow hybrid approach, to start git action workflow"

## Summary
Created comprehensive GitHub Actions Hybrid Workflow documentation following Hybrid Quality Matrix principles:

**Created Documentation:**
GitHub Actions Hybrid Workflow Guide (docs/github-actions-hybrid-workflow.md)

**Hybrid Quality Matrix Principles:**
- **Essential Standards (10/10)**: Non-negotiable standards that block merges
  - Security: No vulnerabilities, proper input validation
  - Critical Functionality: All tests must pass
  - Code Quality: No critical errors, type safety
  - Best Practices: WordPress coding standards, PSR-12

- **Performance Goals (Track Trends)**: Improvement targets, not blockers
  - Performance: Optimize page load, database queries
  - Code Optimization: Reduce bundle sizes, improve algorithms
  - Test Coverage: Target 90%+, but don't block on 80%+
  - Deployment Speed: Track trends, don't block

**Workflow Configurations Covered:**
1. CI Workflow (Tests)
   - Block: Test failures, Coverage <80%
   - Track: Coverage trends (aim 90%+)

2. Code Quality Workflow
   - Block: Critical errors, Type errors, Security vulnerabilities
   - Track: Style violations, Quality score trends

3. Frontend Workflow
   - Block: ESLint errors, Build failures, Test failures
   - Track: Warning counts, Bundle size (<500KB target)

4. Security Workflow
   - Block: High/Critical vulnerabilities, Hardcoded secrets
   - Track: Moderate/Low vulnerabilities, Security score

5. Branch Protection Workflow
   - Block: Invalid PR targets
   - Enforce: Branch protection compliance

**Quality Score Calculation:**
- Formula: Quality Score = 10 - (Critical * 2) - (Major * 0.5) - (Minor * 0.1)
- Production Ready: 0 critical, ≤30 major, ≤120 minor, score ≥7/10, 80%+ coverage

**Workflow Execution:**
- Pull Requests: Block on essential checks, track performance metrics
- Push to Develop: Same essential checks, detect regressions
- Push to Main: All PR checks passed, deployment verification

**Branch Protection Rules:**
- Main: Require PR reviews, status checks, linear history, restrict direct pushes
- Develop: Require PR reviews, status checks, linear history, restrict direct pushes

**Key Features:**
- Never block on performance goals (only track trends)
- Show improvement opportunities with actionable recommendations
- Maintain essential standards at 10/10
- Transparent reporting with exact scores and metrics
- Continuous improvement through trend monitoring

**Available Workflows:**
- .github/workflows/ci.yml - PHPUnit tests across PHP 8.1-8.4
- .github/workflows/code-quality.yml - PHPStan, PHPCS static analysis
- .github/workflows/frontend.yml - ESLint, Stylelint, frontend tests
- .github/workflows/security.yml - Dependency audits, security scans
- .github/workflows/branch-protection.yml - Branch protection verification
- .github/workflows/deploy.yml - Deployment automation
- .github/workflows/phpunit.yml - PHPUnit testing
- Plus CI/CD Docker, plan checking, and verification workflows

**Next Steps:**
- Review hybrid workflow documentation for detailed configuration
- Apply hybrid approach to existing workflows (update ci.yml, code-quality.yml, frontend.yml, security.yml)
- Set up branch protection rules in GitHub Settings
- Use quality score calculation for PR assessments
- Track performance metrics trends over time

- ✅ assistant-rule.md (APPLIED)
- ❌ assistant-quality-standards.md (NOT USED)
- ❌ assistant-performance-optimization.md (NOT USED)

## Summary
Successfully read and understood both assistant instruction and rule files. Key requirements confirmed:
- Universal output format for all attempt_completion messages (User Request, Assistant Files Used, Summary sections with timestamp)
- Mandatory chat history updates after EVERY task completion
- Git operations require explicit permission (never auto-commit/push/branch)
- Pre-completion checklist verification before using attempt_completion
- Only list files that were actually used with ✅/❌ markers
- Never provide time estimates for tasks
- Never start writing code unless explicitly told to do so
- Backup branch naming must follow backup-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM format

Created first chat history file (Chat-001-2026-01-18-0109.md) in chat-history directory. All rules and requirements are now understood and will be followed strictly for all future tasks.
