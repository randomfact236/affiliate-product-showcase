# Roo Code Rules - Consolidated

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Rules Moved

All assistant rules have been consolidated to the `.clinerules/` directory to prevent duplication and divergence.

## 📍 Canonical Rule Locations

| Rule Category | Location |
|--------------|----------|
| **Core Instructions** | `.clinerules/assistant-instructions.md` |
| **Quality Standards** | `.clinerules/assistant-quality-standards.md` |
| **Performance Guide** | `.clinerules/assistant-performance-optimization.md` |

## 📝 Notes

- This directory previously contained `rules.md` which has been removed
- All Roo Code rules are now maintained in `.clinerules/` as the single source of truth
- See `.clinerules/assistant-instructions.md` for complete workflow rules
