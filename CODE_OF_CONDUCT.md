# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
- Using inclusive and welcoming language
- Being patient and supportive with newcomers
- Keeping discussions focused on improving the project
- Celebrating contributions and achievements

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
- Disruptive behavior that prevents collaboration
- Hate speech, discrimination, or harassment
- Retaliation against individuals who report issues

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they take in response to a violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: Warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from all sorts of interaction or communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction or communication within the community.

## Reporting

For instances of harassment, discrimination, or other Code of Conduct violations, please contact the project maintainer:

- **Email**: [Maintainer Email]
- **GitHub**: [Create a private issue or discussion]

All reports will be:

1. **Reviewed**: Within 24 hours by a community leader
2. **Confidential**: Kept private and not disclosed without consent
3. **Investigated**: Thoroughly and fairly
4. **Addressed**: With appropriate action taken
5. **Followed-up**: With the reporter on the outcome

### What to Include in a Report

When reporting an incident, please include:

- Your contact information (so we can follow up)
- Names or usernames of those involved
- Description of what happened
- When and where it occurred
- Any evidence (screenshots, links, etc.)
- Any other context that may be helpful

### Anonymity

If you prefer to remain anonymous, you may report without identifying yourself, but please note that this may limit our ability to take action.

## Investigation Process

Upon receiving a report, community leaders will:

1. **Acknowledge receipt** within 24 hours
2. **Gather information** from all parties involved
3. **Review evidence** and context
4. **Determine severity** and appropriate response
5. **Take action** based on enforcement guidelines
6. **Communicate outcome** to reporter (and violator if appropriate)

## Appeals

Individuals who have been subject to moderation actions may appeal by:

1. Contacting the project maintainer
2. Providing additional context or information
3. Requesting a review of the decision

Appeals will be reviewed by a different community leader or maintainer than the one who made the original decision.
